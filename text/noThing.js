                nothing.














        It was the first day of winter when I first felt it.








                          Like icy tendrils



                                    which wrapped
                                    around my 
                                    heart.













                      I remember realizing that

                      it would end.














                      No, that

                      I would end.















      And being so scared








                            of what lay beyond.
































         I remember looking out my window



         on the darkest night of the year.









         a moment



                            frozen


                                    in time 










                        And just feeling so












                        alone.

















          I could tell it was coming



          And even though I couldn't
          erase the dread,



          there was a deep peacefulness there.
          
          





          

          I began to leave this world on 

          a journey was mine alone.






















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































   Every

        thing  


            I 

              was 


                 ever 

                    scared 

                        of 

                          meant 


              
             



              nothing


                
                




      in 
          the 

              face 

                    of 
                        this 


                              love.





































































































































































































































































































































































                It was darker than I imagined













                The space beyond the light










                And I knew my moment was gone.






























                My only regret



                was ever making a decision


                out of fear, 


                instead of hope.
