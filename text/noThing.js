                nothing.














        It was the first day of winter when I first felt it.








                          Like icy tendrils



                                    which wrapped
                                    around my 
                                    heart.













                      I remember realizing that

                      it would end.














                      No, that

                      I would end.















      And being so scared








                            of what lay beyond.
































                            I remember loking out my window



         on the darkest night of the year.









         a moment



                            frozen


                                    in time 










                        And just feeling so












                        alone.

















          I was surrounded by loved ones



          who were there with me until the end





          but this final moment


          was mine alone.






























































































































































































                Everything  I was scared of meant


                noThing



                in the face of this love.









































                It was darker than I imagined













                The space after the gold










                And I knew my moment was gone.






























                My only regret



                was ever making a decision


                our of fear, 


                instead of hope.
