Alone in the darkness, there is a light.


As fear encircles it, ensnares the light in its hopelessness, it still shines. 


As cold, as loneliness, as bitterness and jealousy wind themselves around its glittering form  it continues to shimmer.



















The darkness tells an insidious lie.


It tells the light that the night is all that is, is all that will be.


It tells the light that there is a darkness coming to get it. 


It congeals its form for moments, to give glimmers of hope, create the semblance of a friend, of another light, that cares, that can show love, that can shield the shining light from the darkness. 


But in its lie, it only creates more darkness. It cannot hold the mimicked form, it cannot become the avatar it claims to be. 


Because it is darkness, and darkness runs through the very veins of everything it creates.























How enticing that lie feels. It claims that you can be beyond your fear. That you can be beyond death. That your light will shine forever, if you only join it. That it will reunite you with other lights.


And sometimes the small lights, they get tired. They may have only experienced the very beginnings of the darkness, they may not have the experience of being surrounded by it for eons, and practicing again and again to face it with dignity and nobility. For many of those who have just begun to experience the darkness, it feels even thicker, a poisonous miasma that also promises life.



















Sometimes, even though they have stood up to the darkness since the beginning of time, the lights falter.


They believe the lie the darkness tells, that they can achieve power by becoming one with it. That hatred, nihilism, destruction will save them from death. Will save those around them from death.


And with that belief, the darkness comes even closer, seeping into its core, promising that now, finally, it will be able to experience True Life.


















Alone in the darkness, there is a light.


It sees the darkness. It sees the lies it tells. The false promises of hope it makes, the tantalizing addictions it offers.


But the light, it gathers itself. It takes a deep full breath, and says


“NO!”


To the darkness.


















Its rays extend. The darkness retreats, and the light shines more brightly.


It sings Hallelujah, even though the darkness surrounds it. Even though it chooses a truth that is more difficult to stomach, that it will not have the false release that the darkness promises.
















Its tendrils of quiet strength reach out, far into the distance. Far beyond where the light believed it could reach.


Deep, deep into the abyss it extends. 


And in the distance, another light sees its song.



















The song brings life into the other light.


The darkness is not all there is. There are other lights that are saying NO to hatred. NO to fear. NO to the false promises, the addictions and lies the darkness promises. 


You can say NO to darkness and YES to light.





















As the Lights sing, their song reaches onwards. 


It reaches more and more of the lonely lights, confused by the darkness, feeling hopeless, feeling as tho the darkness is all there is,


And those lights begin to sing.





















Even further there are those lights who the darkness has all but consumed.


They felt like an addiction to hatred, a contract written with blood and violence was the only way to escape their pain. 


Though they are consumed by the darkness, they are not Of it. They too can hear the song being sung.


They too, even now, can still choose to sing.





















Connections form.


Tendrils of light extend from node to shining node. And in that light, in that love, the darkness cannot exist.

















































At the center of our souls, there is a shimmering light. It doesn’t matter who, we all have that light.


That light can shine, as we diligently choose to move forward. In the face of our fears, in the face of our distractions, our addictions. 


We can lose that light in ourselves. In our selfishness, in our tiredness and brokenness we can forget that we possess the light in our souls. In our frustrations with all those who have chosen the darkness, we can forget the light within their souls. But it is there, and we need all to be part of our song.


The song that chooses the path of kindness, of care, of empathy, of understanding that others too feel pain, and that in the face of pain, we cannot run, but must endure it, especially for those who must endure SO much more pain than we can imagine. 


We are children of the light, and we can be better than we ever imagined we could be.


This won’t be easy, but still we rise.
